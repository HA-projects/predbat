My Victron-Energy Predbat Setup üöÄÔ∏è
============================

This [Predbat](https://github.com/springfall2008/batpred/)  configuration files that are used to control my energy management system.
This a work in progress, currently it is not yet working as it should.

Note, You should consider using Victrons build-in Dynamic ESS instead of Predbat as it is really simple to use.

In my case in a No-feedin scenario with EV-Charger Dynamic ESS did not work as expected.


Solar / PV: Victron Energy Multiplus connected via modbus
---------------------------------------------------------

ESS means Energy Storage System and does allow the control of the battery usage.
