My Victron-Energy Predbat Setup üöÄÔ∏è
============================

This [Predbat](https://github.com/springfall2008/batpred/)  configuration files that are used to control my energy management system.
This a work in progress, currently it is not yet working as it should.

plus Shelly EM (Energy Meter) for power consumption tracking.
